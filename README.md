### PLEASE NOTE THIS PRINTER IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

The goal of this printer is to make a cheap easy to build 3D printer than can be built by anyone.

## Features:

- 180 x 180 Build Volume
- 3D Printed Frame
- CoreXY
- Triple Belted Z
- Only Roughly $400 USD in cost

## Build F.A.Q

- I print with 3 walls and 15 percent infill, if you want stronger go 4 walls 20 percent infill should be plenty
- I use PLA for the prototype and it worked well, ABS and ASA would be great too
- This printer uses all F695 bearings with some 20t idlers for the belted Z
